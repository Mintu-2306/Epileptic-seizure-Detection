# Epileptic-seizure-Detection
A hybrid deep learning model combining CNN and LSTM for accurate classification of epileptic seizures from EEG signals. The model leverages both raw 1D EEG time series and 2D time-frequency representations (spectrograms and scalograms) to extract spatial and temporal features.
